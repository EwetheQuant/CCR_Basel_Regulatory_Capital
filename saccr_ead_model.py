# Banks are required by regulators to set aside capital for Counterparty Credit Risk
# Basel has prescribed the SA-CCR EAD model for estimating the Exposure At Default for Counterparty Credit Risk
# There are two main components of the model:

  RC: Replacement Cost
  PFE: Potential Future Exposure

  EAD = 1.4 * (RC + PFE)
